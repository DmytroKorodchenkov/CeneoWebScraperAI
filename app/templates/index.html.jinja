    <h2>Stages of project</h2>
    <p>
        1) Extraction of elements for a single opinion to separate variables<br>
        2) Extraction of elements for a single opinion to one complex variable (dictionary)<br>
        3) Extraction of all opinions form single page to list of dictionaries<br>
        4) Extraction of all opinions for certain product and saving it to .json file<br>
        5) Code refactoring and optimization<br>
            1) Definition of function for extracting single elements of page from HTML code
            2) Creation of dictionary that describes opinions' structure with selectors for particular opinion's elements
            3) Using dictionary comprehension to extract all opinion's elements on the basis of opinions' structure dictionary
        6) Adjustment of data types for different opinions' elements<br>
        7) Translation of certain opinion's elements into English <br>
        8) Analysis of extracted opinions<br>
            1. Basic statistics<br>
                1) Number of all opinions about the product<br>
                2) Number of opinions with list of advantages<br>
                3) Number of opinions with list of disadvantages<br>
                4) Average score based on stars<br>
            2. Plots<br>
                1) Share of recommendations in total number of opinions<br>
                2) Frequency histogram of stars<br>

        9)Complete Used Libraries list description <br>

        10)Modifying the routing to the home page (/) in such a way that the interpreted content of the README.md file is displayed on it.<br>

        googletrans=(Googletrans is a free and unlimited python library that implemented Google Translate API. This uses the Google Translate Ajax API to make calls to such methods as detect and translate.)<br>

        h11=(h11's goal is to be a simple, robust, complete, and non-hacky implementation of the first “chapter” of the HTTP/1.1 spec: RFC 7230: HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing<br>

        h2=(H2 is an open-source lightweight Java database. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode)<br>

        hpack=( its used to compress HTTP headers in HTTP/2)<br>

        hstspreload=(Chromium HSTS Preload list as a Python package. The package provides a single function: in_hsts_preload() which takes an IDNA-encoded host and returns either True or False regarding whether that host should be only accessed via HTTPS)<br>

        httpcore=(The HTTP Core package provides a minimal low-level HTTP client, which does one thing only. Sending HTTP requests)<br>

        httpx=(HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.)<br>
